         * Construct a pivot ramp prototype robot.

         * The motor groups passed into this constructor require careful
         * consideration.  It is up to the caller -- to YOU -- to ensure that
         * all the motors turn in the correct direction (including calling
         * setReverse() as needed) so that nothing is damaged when the motor
         * group's velocity is set.
         *
         * @param left   The list of all motors on the left side of the drive.
         *               Setting each motor's velocity to a positive value
         *               should cause the left side of the robot to drive
         *               forward.
         * @param right  The list of all motors on the right side of the drive.
         *               Setting each motor's velocity to a positive value
         *               should cause the right side of the robot to drive
         *               forward.
         * @param intake The list of all motors responsible for intaking.
         *               Setting the velocity +1 will be full power intaking
         *               while -1 will be full power outaking. 0 will be no
         *               motion.
         * @param lift   The motor group handling all motors responsible for
         *               moving the lift. The position passed into the lift
         *               function is a value between 0 and 1 that represents a
         *               percentage of the lift's maximum extension.
         * @param rotationsToTop The number of rotations that the lift's input
         *               motor has to make for the lift to extend.  This value
         *               must be determined experimentally (please see
         *               setLiftRotationsDebug()).
         * @param pneumaticsClamp A digital_out object connected to a double
         *               solenoid for controlling pneumatic mobile goal grabber.
         * @param pneumaticsClimb A digital_out object connected to the
         *               pneumatics responsible for the climb hooks.
