# Marketing Table Bot

This is the code for a robot, developed by VEX Team 1759P in April-May 2025,
which can be used at tables for El Segundo High School Robotics Club events.
It is deliberately designed be stationary (no drive), and to be versatile
enough and safe enough that visitors to our booths will be able to use it for
games and fun activities.

## Requirements

As agreed by the Marketing Team on 2025-04-20:

| ID  | Requirement | Proposed by | Notes |
| :-- |  :--------- | :---------- | :---- |
| 1 | As a user, I should be able to fire the shooter bot by pressing a button. |[Gavin](https://discord.com/channels/692859187780255744/694330442794402035/1363267254740844616) | |
| 2 | As a user, I should be able to rotate the barrel in two axes using either the arrow buttons or a joystick. | Gavin | This implies a controller.  Will there be a way to aim without one -- say, using bump sensors as buttons? |
| 3 | As a user, I should be able to reload the bot by putting **the ping-pong balls** in the tube. | Gavin | |
| 4 | The bot should hold at least 5 ping pong balls at once. | Gavin | |
| 5 | As a user, I should be able to have a maximum shooting distance of one meter. | Gavin | See **ID 10** |
| 6 | For demonstrations, the bot should use a color sensor to auto-aim at targets. (plus some math to figure out its arc) | Gavin | |
| 7 | Whatever the robot shoots, the projectile should not injure anyone hit at point-blank range | Anya | Needs to be balanced with **ID 10**; there will be a healthy medium weâ€™ll need to test. |
| 8 | As a user, I should not have to make repairs on the bot constantly, or have the bot break often | Vincent | |
| 9 | It should take up as little space as possible, so for events with limited space, we can still bring it | Vincent | |
| 10 | Refinement of **ID 5**: the bot should have the ability to shoot further, however, it should be dialed back for events. | Vincent | 1 meter is too short for many of the targeting ideas |
| 11 | The design needs to incorporate polycarb so we can use the leftover polycarb from FRC. The polycarb will be used for decoration like adding cute and cool stickers. | Leo | |
